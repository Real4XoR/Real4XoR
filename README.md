I have too many things all on the go at once and I keep telling myself that I'll get to them eventually, but we all know how that goes.

I'm currently developing a portofilio website, keeping my uni repos up to date while also doing way to many personal projects so take a dive into what I spend my time doing. Or don't I won't judge (I will).

anyways I currently work as a pentester doing all sorts of cool stuff. ðŸ’ª
